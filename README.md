Turn GitHub Repo to CDN

1. The base URL is https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/{username}/{repo}/, where you replace {username} with the GitHub username and {repo} with the repository name for the project.


2. Append that URL with the path to the file you want to access in the project. For example, for my Atomic XHR plugin, the JavaScript file is located in the /dist directory. Youâ€™d use this:
GitHub Link:
https://github.com/cferdinandi/atomic/blob/master/dist/atomic.js

Script Tag:
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cferdinandi/atomic/dist/atomic.js"></script>

3. You can also take advantage of semantic versioning by adding @{version-number} to the repository name. You can target major, minor, and patch releases as desired.
<!-- Always get the latest version -->
<!-- Not recommended for production sites! -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cferdinandi/atomic/dist/atomic.js"></script>

<!-- Get minor updates and patch fixes within a major version -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cferdinandi/atomic@4/dist/atomic.js"></script>

<!-- Get patch fixes within a minor version -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cferdinandi/atomic@4.0/dist/atomic.js"></script>

<!-- Get a specific version -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/cferdinandi/atomic@4.0.0/dist/atomic.js"></script>
